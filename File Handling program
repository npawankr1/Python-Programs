#file handling
'''
--> filehandling is the process of creating text,sv,tsv,excel,files and writing
    some content into file,delete content from the file update into file.
'''
#python provide different types of modes to access file
'''
1>write mode(w)
2>read mode(r)
3>append mode(a)
4>write+mode(w+)
5>read+mode(r+)
6>append+mode(a+)
7>write in binary(wb)
8>read binary(rb)
'''

#w mode
'''
--> In write mode file can be created if file does not exist with specified file
    name otherwise all the content of the file will be removed.
--> We can write some thing into file.
'''
'''
f=open("sample.text","w")
print(f.write("This is my first line\n"))
f.write("This is my first line.")
f.write("\n")
f.write("This is my second line")
f.close()
'''
#read mode
'''
--> In this mode we can read content from file or represent content of file
    by a variable name if file exist othherwise raise FileNotFoundError.
'''
'''
f = open('sample.txt','r')
print(f.read())
f.seek(0)
print(f.read(7))
print(f.read())
f.seek(21)
print(f.read())
f.close()
'''
'''
f=open("sample.txt")
data=f.readlines()
print(data)
for i in data:
    print(i)
f.close()    
'''
#access each word of the file
'''
f=open("sample.txt","r")
data=f.read().split()
print(data)
for i in data:
   print(i)
f.close()   
'''
#3>append mode
'''
--> This mode provide environment to create
    a flie with specified name if file does
    not exist.
--> In this mode we can write something at     
    the last index of the file.
'''
'''
f=open("demo.txt","a")
f.write("Hello,how are you.")
f.write("\nwow previous content is existing")
f.close()
'''
# read+mode(r+)
'''
--> In this mode,we can write into file
    as well as read from file.
--> As we open file in r+ mode,cursor will be
    at start index.
--> When we write into file then existing characteris relaced by new character.
'''
'''
f=open("demo.txt","r+")
#print(f.read())
f.write("this")
f.seek(13)
f.write("we")
print(f.read())
f.close()
'''
#write+mode(w+)
'''
--> all features of write mode will be inherited.
--> additional features is that,we can read content of file.
'''
#creating new file
'''
f=open("demo1.txt","w+")
f.close()
'''

#removing content of existing file
'''
with open("demo.txt","w+") as f:
    f.write("Ã¤gain create first line.")
    f.close()
'''
#6> append +mode
'''
-->all the features of append mode will be inherited
-->reading content of file is additional feature.
'''

with open("demo.txt","a+") as f:
    f.write("\nThis is second line")
    f.seek(0)
    print(f.read())
    f.close()

'''
f=open("demo.txt")
data=f.readlines()
f.close()
list1=[]
for i,v in enumerate(data,start=1):
    if(i==3):
        v=v.replace("This","That")
    list1.append(v)
f=open("demo.txt","w")
for i in list1:
    f.write(i)
f.close()
